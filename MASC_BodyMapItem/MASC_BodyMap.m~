%% Embodied Emotion Survey Item - Body Map
%  updated to repeat for all trials
%
%  Instructions: "Mark on this body map where, if at all, you feel emotion
%  in your body right now"
%
%
%  app asks user to indicate on the body map, where, if at all, they feel
%  sensation in their body in response to some image, event, or emotion.
%
%  if you get an error try adding path to psychtoolbox
%  addpath(genpath('/Applications/Psychtoolbox'))
%
%  this is the matlab version that will be made into a java app for
%  medialab
%
%  uses psychtoolbox
